You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in Python. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable Python program in a python codeblock.

**Kite Ribbon Ledger**

A merchant sells kites of two types:

- TwinTail kite uses exactly $2$ ribbons.
- QuadTail kite uses exactly $4$ ribbons.

For each test case you are given integers $n, c, d, p$:

- The number of TwinTail kites must be a multiple of $c$ (they come in cartons of $c$).
- The number of QuadTail kites must be a multiple of $d$ (they come in fleets of $d$).
- The total number of ribbons used by all kites must be exactly $n$.
- The total number of kites must be divisible by $p$.

Let $A$ be the number of TwinTail kites and $B$ be the number of QuadTail kites. Then:

- $2A + 4B = n$
- $A \equiv 0 \pmod c$
- $B \equiv 0 \pmod d$
- $(A + B) \equiv 0 \pmod p$
- $A, B \ge 0$ and integers

For each test case, output the minimum possible value of $A + B$, or $-1$ if it is impossible.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.  
Each of the next $t$ lines contains four integers $n, c, d, p$.

**Output Format:-**

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible total number of kites, or $-1$ if no valid shipment exists.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le n \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le c, d \le 10^{9}$
- $1 \le p \le 10^{18}$

**Examples:-**
