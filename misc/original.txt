**Problem Statement**
Farmer John arrived at his farm and counted a total of \(n\) legs.

It is known that only two kinds of animals live on the farm:
- Chickens, which have \(2\) legs each
- Cows, which have \(4\) legs each

Assuming Farmer John counted the legs of **all** animals, determine the **minimum possible number of animals** on the farm.

**Input Format**
The first line contains an integer \(t\) \((1 \le t \le 10^3)\) — the number of test cases.

Each of the next \(t\) lines contains a single even integer \(n\) \((2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^3)\) — the total number of legs counted.

**Output Format**
For each test case, output one integer: the minimum number of animals that could have exactly \(n\) legs in total.

**Examples**
Input:
```
3
2
6
8
```

Output:
```
1
2
2
```

**Editorial**
To minimize the number of animals, we should use as many cows as possible since each cow contributes \(4\) legs (more legs per animal than a chicken).

- If \(n\) is divisible by \(4\), we can use only cows:
  \[
  \text{answer} = \frac{n}{4}
  \]
- Otherwise \(n\) is even, so the only remaining case is \(n \bmod 4 = 2\).  
  Then we must include at least one chicken (contributing \(2\) legs), and the remaining \(n-2\) legs can be made by cows:
  \[
  \text{answer} = 1 + \frac{n-2}{4}
  \]

This yields the minimum number of animals.

**Code**
```python
import sys

def main() -> None:
    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    out = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        if n % 4 == 0:
            out.append(str(n // 4))
        else:
            out.append(str((n - 2) // 4 + 1))
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(out))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
